# Tailwind Color Combos

When creating a theme system for a recent project, I wanted to see how combinations from the default Tailwind color palette worked together. This app is a way to choose a primary, secondary and tertiary color from the extended Tailwind color palette and see how they work together in real time via a few examples.
