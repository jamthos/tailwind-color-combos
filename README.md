# Tailwind Color Combos

When creating a theme system for a project, I wanted to see how combinations of the default tailwind color pallete worked together. This app is a way to choose a primary, secondary and tertiary color from the extended color pallete and see how they work together in a few examples.

## Coming soon

Once you have a color combo you like, you'll have the ability to copy the code needed to add to your tailwind project. You'll then be able use classes like `bg-primary-100` and `text-secondary-900` awith the colors from your combo.
